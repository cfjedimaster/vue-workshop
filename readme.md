## Vue Workshop

Hi! This is the readme for my ([Raymond Camden](https://www.raymondcamden.com)) workshop on Vue.js. I've got
a few repositories on GitHub related to Vue presentations and sometimes even I get confused as to what's what.
This particular repository is for my 2-3 hour long form Vue workshop. I also have a "short" workshop and a regular "one hour"
lecture style presentation. I think eventually I'll merge them all into this repository so it's easier to keep track.

You can find the slide deck in the preso.pptx file (or the PDF export) and the examples under the examples folder.
